**Welcome to the challenge problem section of HHS Programming Club!** &#128578;

These challenge problems are designed to help sharpen your programming skills in a fun and entertaining way. Some of the problems will be quite challenging, but you'll learn a lot by solving them!

To submit a solution to a challenge problem, scroll down to the bottom of the page, choose which programming language you want to use, select the code file that you want to submit, and click the submit button.

When you submit a solution to a challenge problem, your code will be tested against a couple of test cases to make sure your solution is correct. In each test case, your program will be run with a different set of input, and your program should produce the correct output to get the problem correct.

For this problem, your goal is to **output the string "Hello World!" on a single line**. You'll need to print the exact same string to get this problem correct (including capitalization / punctuation).

Not sure which programming language to go for? If you have prior experience with a programming language, that's the one you should use! Otherwise, Java would probably be your best bet, since the school's programming courses (Intro to Programming / APCS) use Java.

In order to write code for the programming language you choose, you'll need to install some stuff. Here are some helpful links to installation tutorials for each language:

Alternatively, if you just want to test out some short code, you can do that without downloading anything by using online code runners like <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a>.

If you ever need hints for a challenge problem, feel free to click on the "Show Hints" button below. There is no penalty for viewing hints, but try your best to solve the problem without them first. It's also completely fine (and encouraged!) to search for help online while doing the challenge problems.
