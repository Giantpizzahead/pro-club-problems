Alice has three metal rods of length $a$, $b$ and $c$ centimeters respectively. In one minute Alice can pick one arbitrary rod and stretch it by exactly $1$ centimeter (Alice is very strong). She is not allowed to break the rods.

What is the **minimum # of minutes** she needs to spend stretching the rods in order to create a triangle of positive area? The metal rods should be used as the triangle's sides (one rod for one side), and their endpoints should be located at the triangle's vertices.

#### INPUT FORMAT

The only line of input contains three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$: The lengths of the three metal rods. These lengths will be given in non-decreasing order.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a single integer: The minimum # of minutes Alice needs to spend in order to make a triangle of positive area from her metal rods.

#### CONSTRAINTS

$1 \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq 10{,}000$

#### EXPLANATION 1

Alice can already create a valid triangle using the metal rods without stretching any of them.

#### EXPLANATION 2

Alice can spend $1$ minute to increase the length of the first metal rod, and $1$ minute to increase the length of the second metal rod. This allows her to form a triangle with lengths $3$, $3$, and $5$ in $2$ minutes. It can be proven that there is no way to get a valid triangle faster.
