Thank you for taking the survey! We really appreciate it ðŸ™‚

Of course, we're not just gonna give you 10 free points though...

This problem is a pretty special one. Your program will receive a single integer $X$ as input, and your goal is to output the correct integer $Y$ back. However, we will not tell you how to find this correct integer.

In order to determine how to find $Y$, you'll need to take a look at the sample inputs and outputs below. **See if you can find a pattern!**

Good luck!

(By the way, I heard there's a hidden test problem somewhere... wasn't this problem hidden too? How did you even solve it when it was hidden? Hmm...)

#### INPUT FORMAT

The only line of input contains a single integer $X$.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a single integer $Y$: The answer to the problem.

#### CONSTRAINTS

$0 \leq X \leq 100{,}000$
(The integer $X$ will be in the range $0...100{,}000$.)
