One day, Blake comes to you and begs you to help him with his homework! He asks you to write a program that can sum two numbers together, and print out the result.

However, as you begin writing this program, you ask yourself: *Why is Blake asking me to do this? Can't he just use a calculator?*

After thinking for a while, you realize that Blake is just SUPER lazy, which also explains why he's doing the homework on the day that it's due. So, you decide to teach Blake a lesson for relying on you to bail him out. You'll write the program for Blake... but you're going to intentionally give him the wrong answers.

Specifically, you should write a program that **sums two numbers together**. However, the result the program prints will always be **2 greater than the actual sum**.

For example, if the two numbers your program receives are $9$ and $10$, your program would output $21$ instead of $19$.

Blake is waiting for you... pull this thing off!

#### INPUT FORMAT

Your program will receive two integers $A$ and $B$, separated by a single space. These are the integers that Blake wants to know the sum of.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

Your program should output one integer. This integer should be exactly 2 more than the sum of the numbers that Blake gave you.
(Output the value of $A + B + 2$.)

#### SAMPLE INPUT
```text
9 10
```

#### SAMPLE OUTPUT
```text
21
```

#### EXPLANATION

$9 + 10 = 19$. Since your program should output 2 more than the actual sum of the numbers, your code should output $21$.

Tip: When you submit a solution, it will be graded against several test cases; in each one, your program will receive a different set of input. Each of these test cases will be displayed as a small box, with the test result in the center. You can hover over each of these boxes to get more detailed info on how your program did.
