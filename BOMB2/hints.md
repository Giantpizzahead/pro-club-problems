1. PLEASE do not try to code all the instructions by hand. These bombs are well designed... they might get through all $1\,337$ instructions!

2. There are two ways to turn the instructions into regular code: Either use regular expressions (find and replace), or write a parser program.

3. Here is a find and replace regex that turns the final instruction into Python code:
```text
Find:    "Cut the ([0-9]*)[a-z]* wire."
Replace: "print('Cut wire \1')"
```
Where the \\1 represents capture group 1.
