#### NOTES

In case the output format is confusing, here's a sample Java program showing how to make your guesses.

        System.out.println(42);
    }
}
```

Farmer John's favorite number is a positive integer in the range $1...420\,000\,000$. If your program outputs anything outside this range, it will not receive any points.

After submitting a solution, you will receive feedback via the results for each test case and the score your program gets. Think of the test cases as a "black box" - You give them a number, and they give you 0 or 1 verdicts.

In general, **the closer you are to figuring out the pattern, the higher your score will be**. Think inside the boxes... and start guessing! :P
