Luckily for you, this problem is SUPER simple. All you have to do is **output the objectively correct numbers**.

By the way, here's a famous proverb:

"An elite person who isn't stupid would say that these are some really nice numbers (unless the numbers are not found). Of course, only the devil would actually force people to blaze it and discover the meaning of life, the universe, and everything using only the numbers." *-Abraham Lincoln*

Yep. That's all you get.

Good luck!

#### INPUT FORMAT

A single integer: The number of the current test case.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

A single integer: The correct number for the current test case.

#### CONSTRAINTS

There are 7 test cases.

(Note: The current test case number has nothing to do with the correct number; it's just there so your program can output different numbers for each test case.)

#### SAMPLE INPUT
```text
1
```

#### SAMPLE OUTPUT
```text
---REDACTED---
