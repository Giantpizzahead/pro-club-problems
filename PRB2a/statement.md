Eve has a computer science exam coming up. This exam will have $3$ questions, and each question will have a point value. Eve is a very responsible student, so she is prepared enough to get full points on every question in the exam.

However, her CS teacher is very strict with time limits... After taking a mock exam, Eve has determined that she will need to skip exactly one question on this test in order to finish in time. She will get no points for the question that she skips.

Of course, Eve wants to get as high a score on this test as possible. Please help Eve determine the **maximum possible score** she can get on the CS exam if she is forced to skip one question.

#### INPUT FORMAT

Your program will receive $3$ space-separated integers as input. These integers represent the number of points that each question is worth.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a single integer: The maximum possible score Eve can get on the CS test if she is forced to skip one question.

#### CONSTRAINTS

The number of points each question is worth will be in the range $1...100$.

#### SAMPLE INPUT
```text
20 10 30
```

#### SAMPLE OUTPUT
```text
50
```

#### EXPLANATION

The 3 questions on the CS exam are worth $20$, $10$, and $30$ points.

To get the best possible score, Eve should skip question $2$. This results in a final score of $20$ + $30$ = $50$ points.

Tip: A quick and easy way to check if your program doesn't have any obvious bugs is to **try running your program locally** on the sample input, and make sure it produces the correct output. This can be done by running the program, copying and pasting the sample input into the console, and making sure that the answer printed by your code is the same as the sample output.
