**What is USACO?**

(A lot of the below information is taken from the official USACO website. You can find more information at <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php" target="_blank">http://usaco.org/index.php</a>.)

USACO stands for the USA Computing Olympiad. The goal of USACO is to identify, motivate, and train high-school computing students at all levels. They do this through online programming contests (roughly four per year) for students at all skill levels.

Top students in USACO contests are invited to an intensive summer training camp, where they further improve their skills and learn advanced material. The top four students from camp have the opportunity to represent the USA at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), the most prestigious international algorithmic programming competition at the high-school level.

To participate in USACO contests, you'll need to create an account on their website. Contests are generally 4 hours long, and they consist of 3 problems of varying difficulty to solve. Although the contest itself lasts 4 hours, you can start the contest at any time within a larger 4 day window (see the schedule on the USACO website). Once you start the contest, your personal 4 hour timer will start counting down, and you'll be able to read and solve the problems.

Normally, there is one easy problem, one medium problem, and one hard problem. An important note is that the problems may not be ordered by increasing difficulty! Make sure to read all the problems in order to find the easiest ones. Also keep in mind that the problems will be challenging; there is a reason why the contest lasts 4 hours! You aren't expected to solve the problems right away. Take some time to think about the problems, and you'll have a much better chance of solving them.

If you do well enough on a USACO contest, you may be promoted to a higher division (Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum). The cutoff is generally around 750 out of 1000. You can reach this score by solving two problems, and getting about 25% partial credit on the third one. Remember that getting partial credit on a problem can be (and often is) the deciding factor of whether or not you get promoted!

For the Bronze contest in particular: Focus on **implementation skills** (using strings, for loops, arrays, etc.), and understand the concept of **brute force** (complete search, or trying all possibilities). A bit of practice with **greedy methods** (choosing the best move at every step of the problem) will help too.

**Mock Contest Format**

The problems in this week's set (apart from File IO) are all part of a mock USACO Bronze contest, but with 4 problems instead of 3. The problems all come from past USACO contests. To help you get used to the USACO website, each problem will contain a link to the official USACO page for that problem. You can read the problem and submit your solutions on the USACO website, and then submit your best solution here to earn points for each problem.

Since these are past USACO problems, there are posted solutions to all the problems available on the USACO website. To get the most out of this mock contest, please do not look at the solutions until you have tried your best to solve each problem.

You'll need to <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=register" target="_blank">create an account</a> on the USACO website to attempt these problems (and to take the actual contest in December).
