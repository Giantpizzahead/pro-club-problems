#### BONUS (30 points)

After noticing the overwhelming success of his swimming pool, Farmer John has decided to extend the pool's hours of operation. Now, the pool is open from time $t=0$ until time $t=10^9$. This means that the start and end points of a lifeguard's shift can also range from $0...10^9$. (The constraints on $N$ have not changed.)

Farmer John still needs to fire exactly one lifeguard. The question remains the same: Given that he must fire exactly one lifeguard, what is the maximum amount of time that can still be covered by the shifts of the remaining lifeguards?
