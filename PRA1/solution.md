This problem asks us to figure out who will win in a game of High Card Wins. In this game, both players receive $N$ cards from a deck of cards numbered $1...2N$. Each turn, both players pick a card to play, and the person with the higher numbered card gets to take both of the cards. The person who runs out of cards loses.

One way to approach a problem like this is to try and figure out whether there is a winning strategy for any of the players. In this case, it turns out that a simple winning strategy exists: Whoever has the highest numbered card (with value $2N$) can simply play that card over and over until the other person runs out of cards.

Since the card with value $2N$ cannot be beaten, the player who doesn't have that card is doomed; none of their cards can beat the opponent's $2N$ card, so they will eventually lose their entire hand.

So, the solution for this problem is as follows: Check if you start out with the card that has value $2N$. If you do, then you win; otherwise, your friend wins.

Note: A common bug in Python submissions was forgetting to convert the cards into integers. This caused Python to treat the card values as strings, leading to weird issues when trying to do things like find the maximum card (In terms of strings, max means last in lexicographical order. One example where this could produce unexpected results is with the card values "100" and "2"). This can be solved by using int(card) to convert the strings into integers.
