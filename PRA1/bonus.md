#### BONUS (10 points)

What if the cards didn't have to be distinct? Who would win this expanded version of the game if both of you play optimally? (The card numbers are still in the range $1...2N$.)

Note: If there is a tie in a given turn (both you and your friend play the same numbered card), both cards are simply discarded. If both players run out of cards at the same time, the game is considered a draw, and your program should print "Draw".
