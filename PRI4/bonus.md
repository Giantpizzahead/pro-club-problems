Farmer John just got a LOT of new cows in his herd! He still needs to choose one to move to his isolation stall, but he's afraid that he won't be able to decide in time...

The bounds for the problem have increased. Other than that, the problem remains the same.

#### CONSTRAINTS

$3 \leq N \leq 3{,}000$

$-10^8 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^8$

The locations of all cows will be distinct.

Tip: Since $3000^3$ is much greater than 100 million, solutions with a cubic time complexity will not run in time. However, $3000^2$ is less than 100 million, so solutions with a quadratic time complexity - sometimes written as $O(N^2)$ - should run in time.
