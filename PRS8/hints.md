1. Be careful when parsing the input for this problem! Depending on the language you are using, there may be hidden newlines ('\n') or carriage returns ('\r') in the strings. If your program seems bugged, try trimming the strings by removing extra spaces and/or newlines at the end of it - most languages have built-in methods for this.

2. Trying all possibilities could get some partial credit (about 50%?) for this problem. For something more efficient, sorting and binary searching might be really useful.

3. Here's a neat trick that might help you earn some more points: Since you know the time limit, you could code some logic that makes the program exit right before hitting the time limit. This way, you can try many more possibilties without running out of time!

4. If you're going for full credit... I encourage you to trie. ðŸ˜‰
Range queries could help too.
